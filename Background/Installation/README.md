# Installing IoT templates and deploying a background app

## Introduction

Receiving, transmitting and analyzing data are essential tasks in IoT scenarios. Some devices are used exclusively for receiving and transmitting data securely; thus, user interaction is not always desired. We will create a background app that runs "headless" (without the need of a keyboard, mouse or monitor) and sends data to Azure.

The background application should be capable of:
* Collecting weather data
* Sending data to Azure
* Receiving user configurations from Azure (for example, changing the frequency that sensor data gets collected)

## Installation

Visual Studio 2017 with Universal Windows Platform support will be used. When installing VS2017, make sure *Universal Windows Platform development* is selected.

Install the [Windows IoT Core Project Templates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MicrosoftIoT.WindowsIoTCoreProjectTemplates) package, which provides a template for background applications on IoT. [More information on background applications can be found here.](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/docs/backgroundapplications)

## Creating a monitoring background application

We will create a simple application background application to run code at a fixed interval. Open Visual Studio and choose *File > New > Project...*. On the *New Project* window, pick the C# background application template and choose a name for the project.

The default template runs `StartupTask` (which is a background task). The `Run` method should be overridden with code to be executed by the app.

We will use a `ThreadPoolTimer` to run a function at fixed intervals. But we must first grab a deferral for this task, since the app is considered done when the `Run` method returns.

```cs
using System;
using Windows.ApplicationModel.Background;
using Windows.System.Threading;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace BackgroundWeatherStation
{
    public sealed class StartupTask : IBackgroundTask
    {
        private BackgroundTaskDeferral _deferral;
        private ThreadPoolTimer _timer;

        public void Run(IBackgroundTaskInstance taskInstance)
        {
            // Grab a deferral to keep the app alive once Run returns.
            _deferral = taskInstance.GetDeferral();
            _timer = ThreadPoolTimer.CreatePeriodicTimer(LogSensorData, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
        }

        private void LogSensorData(ThreadPoolTimer timer)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine("Running on a timer");
        }
    }
}
```

To run this code on a device:
* Choose *Remote Machine* as the target of deployment using the menu bar of Visual Studio.
![Changing to remote machine](ChangingToRemoteMachine.png)
* Pick you device from the list (or enter its IP address manually).
* Run through the menu bar (or press F5).

The message should be printed on the output window every 5 seconds:
